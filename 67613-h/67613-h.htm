<p class="ph2">WHY THESE STORIES<br />
ARE TOLD</p></div>

<p>SEVENTY years ago a group of children gathered
round a wise and kindly Scotchwoman, and ever,
as one tale ended, they shouted, “Tell on, Bell, tell on.”</p>

<p>Some of the stories she told are forgotten, and it is
many days since the fortunes she read were proved true
or false, but other little children re-echo the old request,
and James Chalmers knew well how to answer it when
he wrote for us of Kone and of Aveo, of the wild waves
of the Pacific, and of the wilder men on its islands.</p>

<p>His life’s adventure here is over. He will not come
back to us nor tell us one tale more. But who shall
say that we may not reach him one day, greet him
with the old words, “Tell on, tell on,” and listen, rapt
and eager, to stories of brave deeds and strange voyages
in that new world in which he lives?</p>

<p class="ph2">BOYHOOD IN ARGYLL</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>AMES CHALMERS was born sixty-five
years ago at a little town in the West
Highlands of Scotland. He was the son of
a stonemason, but his home was close to
the sea, and he was more eager to sail than
to build.</p>

<p>One kind of building he did try. That was
boat-building. But he and his little friends
did not find it as easy as it looked, so they
gave it up and tarred a herring-box instead.
When it was ready James jumped into it
for “first sail.” His playmates on the beach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>towed him along by a rope. They were all
enjoying the fun when the rope snapped,
and the herring-box, with James in it,
danced away out to sea. A cry was raised
and a rush made for the shore. The fishermen
were fond of the daring little fellow who
was always in mischief. Soon they caught
him and brought him safe to land. But
they shook their heads when they saw how
fearless he was. They knew he would soon
be in some other danger.</p>

<p>When James was seven years old he left
his first home and went to live in Glenaray,
near Inveraray. Still the mountains of Argyll
rose round his home. They were dim misty
blue in summer, but in autumn and spring
they were strong deep blue like the robes
in stained-glass windows. But the new
home was not on the sea-shore. James
could not tumble about in boats and herring-boxes
all day long as he had done before.</p>

<p>Soon he found another kind of daring to
fill his thoughts. From his home in Glenaray
he and his sisters had three miles to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>walk to school. Other boys and girls crossed
the moors from scattered farm-houses and
crofts. A large number of children came
from the town of Inveraray, and they gathered
to them others whose homes lay between
the town and the school. Here were two
parties of young warriors ready to fight.
James and the moorland groups were the
glen party. The others were the town party.
Some trifle started warfare. First there was
a teasing word, then a divot of turf, and then
before any one knew what had happened,
stones were flying and fists pounding, and
the clans were at war once more on the
shores of Argyll.</p>

<p>The spirit of battle ran so high that on
fighting days James and his sisters did not
go straight home. They joined the larger
number of the glen party and went round
by the homes of the others, so that they had
only the last little bit to go alone. There
they were safe from the foe. But on days
of truce they went with the town party to
the bridges over the Aray. The Aray is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>wild mountain stream, and when rain falls
in the hills, it rushes wildly down and carries
all before it.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the sunshine had
burst out after heavy rain, the children were
going home together. As they came near
the bridges the rush of the water and its
noise drew them close to the banks of the
stream.</p>

<p>James was there. He heard a cry:
“Johnnie Minto has fallen in!”</p>

<p>He threw off his coat and gave a quick
glance up the stream. There he saw
Johnnie’s head appear and disappear in the
rush of the water. Without a moment’s
thought he slid down to the lower side of
the bridge and caught his arm round one
of its posts. Just above him Johnnie was
tumbling down in the wild water. One
quick clutch and James held him firmly.
The water was so fierce and rapid that it
seemed he must let go. He did let go, but
it was the bridge that he lost hold of, not
the boy! He let the current carry them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>both down till he could catch a branch
that overhung the water. By it he pulled
himself and his little foe (for Johnnie was
of the town party) towards the edge of the
stream till the other boys could reach them
and drag them on to the bank.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" width="400" alt="A branch that overhung the water"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">A branch that overhung the water</p>

<p class="gap">Once James heard a letter read that had
come from an island on the other side of
the world. It told of the sorrows and
cruelties that savages have to bear. He
was touched. The stories of hardship made
him wish to do and dare all that the writer
of the letter had dared. The stories of
sorrow made him long to help. He said
to himself that he too would go when he
became a man.</p>

<p>But soon he forgot all about that, and
thought only of how much fun he could get
as the days passed.</p>

<p>As he grew older he became very wild. He
could not bear to meet any one who might
urge him to live a better life.</p>

<p>He entered a lawyer’s office, but the work
did not interest him, and he filled his free
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>time with all kinds of pranks, so that soon
he was blamed for any mischief that was
on foot in the town.</p>

<p>He was the leader of the wildest boys in
Inveraray, but he himself was led only by
his whims and the fancy of the moment.
Until one day he found his own leader, who
made work and play more interesting and
delightful than they had ever been before.</p>

<p>James found that his life was not aimless
any longer. It was full of one great wish&mdash;the
wish to serve his hero, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Then he thought of his old longing to
go and help those who were in pain and
sorrow far away from Scotland.</p>

<p>It was not only because he was sorry for
them, and because he wished to do the
brave and daring things that others had
done. These thoughts still drew him on.
But far more than these, the love he had
for his newly found Master made him wish
to go.</p>

<p>He felt that it was a grand thing to be
alive and young, and able to do something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>to bring to other lives the joy and strength
that had come into his own.</p>

<p>Before he could go, however, he had to
learn many things.</p>

<p>He went to stay at Cheshunt College,
near London. The head of the college was
a great man. It made it easier to be good
to live beside him. Often afterwards,
amongst hardships and dangers, his
students thought of him, and of what he
had said to them at Cheshunt, and were
braver and stronger because of him.</p>

<p>While James Chalmers was at college,
part of his work was to preach at a village
eight miles away, and to go to see the
people who were in trouble there. He
was a big strong man, and enjoyed his
walk of sixteen miles. Perhaps that was
why this village, the farthest from the college,
was placed under his care. The
people there loved him, and to-day they
still are glad to think that the “Apostle of
New Guinea,” as he was afterwards called,
once preached and worked amongst them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Chalmers could be solemn when he
spoke of God and of life and death, and
when he was with the villagers in times
of sorrow and pain. But he still enjoyed all
the glad things of life that he had loved
in his boyhood, boating and swimming and
fun of all kinds.</p>

<p>If he was in a restless mood when the
others wished to study, the only way they
could make him quiet was to give him
charge of his part of the house. Then woe
betide the man who made a noise. If
some one else tried to keep order and he
wished to romp, nothing would silence him.</p>

<p>One evening at supper time, as the
students sat talking round the table, they
heard a slow lumbering step in the passage.
“Pad-sh, pad-sh,” it came, nearer
and nearer, till the door burst open, and
a great grisly bear walked in on his hind
legs. The men started up. The bear
shuffled in amongst them. He grabbed a
quiet timid student. Then the lights went
out!</p>

title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">The great grisly creature</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p class="gap">There was a great scrimmage. No one
knew where the bear was, and no one
could find matches. Even brave men did
not wish to be caught in the dark by a
runaway bear!</p>

<p>When at last the lights were lit, and
they saw a man’s face looking out from
under the great head of the bear, they did
not know whether to laugh more at him
or at themselves.</p>

<p>They had been jumping here and there
and dodging about, to get out of the way
of James Chalmers in a bearskin!</p>

<p>The students were not the only people
who were alarmed at the made-up bear.
There was an Irishman who came to the
college to sell fruit. One day, as he found
his way along the halls, he met the bear.
It was at the end of a passage, and they
met so suddenly that the poor Irishman
could save neither himself nor his basket
from the paws of the great grisly creature.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE “JOHN WILLIAMS”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN James Chalmers was twenty-four
years of age, he and his wife left
England for Australia in the <i>John Williams</i>.
The lady he had married was eager to help
in the great work that he had undertaken,
so they were both very happy when they
knew that they had really started on their
long voyage. They enjoyed life on board
ship and won many friends amongst the
passengers and amongst the sailors.</p>

<p>The ship in which they sailed was new,
and was one of the swiftest on the sea.
She had been built with money given by
hundreds of children, that she might take
Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers and others who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>went to live as they did, from island to
island on the Pacific sea.</p>

<p>They arrived safely at Sydney, in Australia,
and from that town they sailed for the second
part of their voyage.</p>

<p>The name of the island on which their
first home was to be was Rarotonga. They
could not go straight to it because others
were on board, and the <i>John Williams</i> had
to sail here and there amongst many islands.
At one, two of her passengers must be left
behind; at another, new voyagers must come
on board; while here, there, and everywhere
great bales of cargo must be landed. In
these bales there were beads and knives,
tomahawks and tobacco, and iron in bars,
and rolls of cloth.</p>

<p>All these things were the money the white
people used when they wished to buy food,
or land, or boats, or houses from the people
who lived in the islands.</p>

<p>It was very awkward to have to carry yards
and yards of cloth instead of silver coins
or bank notes! But bank notes and coins
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>would have been of no use to the islanders;
so the only way to do was to take to them
what they wished, and the things the <i>John
Williams</i> carried in her hold were the
things they liked best.</p>

<p>Round many of the islands in the Pacific
lie reefs. The reefs are built of coral by
tiny insects, and they rise from a great
depth almost to the surface of the water.
The mingling colours of the coral are very
wonderful when they are seen through the
liquid blue and green of the waves.</p>

<p>But although these reefs are beautiful,
they are very dangerous. If a ship runs
upon one, the great waves quickly dash
her to pieces as they break over her.</p>

<p>There are openings where the reef is
broken for a short distance, or where its
crest lies so far under the surface of the
water that boats may safely enter the calm
bays that lie within.</p>

<p>Very few ships had sailed in those seas
fifty years ago. The captains had to guess
where the reefs lay. Sometimes they sailed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>slowly, dropping a long line with a weight
at the end of it, to find out if the ship had
entered more shallow water. This is called
“heaving the lead.”</p>

<p>As the <i>John Williams</i> sailed near the first
island at which she was to anchor, her
passengers were watching the shore; they
were delighted with the beauty of the
island. It was a clear afternoon, and the
rich land and trees offered a kind welcome
to those who were to work there. Those
who meant to go farther on, to other islands,
thought that if this first stopping-place
were like the others, there would, for them
too, be much to enjoy.</p>

<p>The reefs amongst which their vessel was
sailing were beautiful, and their eyes were
dazzled by the glisten and glimmer of
colour under the water at the ship’s side.</p>

<p>All at once those who were not standing
very firmly on the deck were thrown down,
and every one was trying not to believe the
truth. But very soon no one could doubt
it. Their beautiful ship had run on an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>unseen rock. She had all sail set and was
going fast, so it was with a great crash
that she struck.</p>

<p>Every one thought of what must be done
to save the ship and her cargo. If they
had had time to look round they would
have seen hundreds of dark men running
about the shore and hauling canoes to the
water’s edge. In a very short time the
canoes were all round the ship, and the men
were clambering up on deck.</p>

<p>Though they knew very little English,
they all spoke at once, and they shook
hands with every one. Then they began to
help to work. It was a strange sight.
Dark men and white all together hauled
down the sails and launched the boats.
Close to the reef, dark men dived into the
water with blankets soaked in tar. They
hoped to stop the holes the reef had made
in the ship. White men gathered clothes
and books and cargo together, and saw
them put into the boats to be sent on shore.
Through all the noise of boxes hauled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>along the decks and thrown out of the
way, and high voices shouting questions
and orders, came the steady thud of the
pumps and the swish of the water as it
poured back to the sea from the hold.</p>

<p>At high water the ship looked shattered,
it is true, but when low tide came she
looked ridiculous. Her stern went down
as the tide fell, but her bows stuck fast
high up on the reef. She looked like a
great rocking-horse whose head has got
so high that it cannot get down again.</p>

<p>So she rocked up and down twice a day
with the tide, till at last, after all her cargo
had been taken on shore, she was heaved
off the reef into deep water. A great shout
of joy rose as she slipped free.</p>

<p>But though she was free, she was greatly
damaged, and had to go back to Sydney for
repairs. She returned to the island nearly ten
weeks later, as strong and seaworthy as ever.</p>

<p>Then they sailed away again, first to the
Loyalty Islands and then to Savage Island.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers saw how glad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>many of the natives were to welcome back
their white friends. They saw, too, that the
lives of men and women who had been
savages had become noble and brave because
white men who loved Jesus Christ had gone
to live amongst them. This made them long
greatly to reach their own home and begin
work there.</p>

<p>The ship was ready to sail from Savage
Island. All the bales of cloth and the bars
of iron that were to be left there had been
put on shore. The cocoanuts and other gifts
that the natives had brought had been taken
to the ship. Every one hoped to sail for
Samoa next morning. Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers
went on board, while some of those
who were to sail with them stayed on land
for one night longer.</p>

<p>At night the wind fell and a great calm
lay on everything. The <i>John Williams</i> lay
out to sea, far beyond the reef, with her bow
heading away from the island. The air was
warm and the southern night seemed full of
peace to all except the captain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>
<p>Though the ship had been lying waiting
to set sail, she was not at anchor. No anchor
could find holding-ground in the great depth
of water.</p>

<p>The captain saw that his ship had been
caught in a current, and that she was being
carried steadily backwards to the island.
Between the ship and the island lay the
reef!</p>

<p>The <i>John Williams</i> had three boats. One
after another they were launched and filled
with rowers. Each boat carried a strong
line with her. By these three lines the
captain hoped the boats might hold the
vessel against the current. The men were
strong and eager to save their ship. They
rowed to the seaward side of her and pulled
hard at the oars. They toiled on and on
till they were tired and aching, but still
they lost way. Faster and faster the ship
drifted towards the reef, dragging her boats
after her.</p>

<p>Again they tried to anchor, but still no
bottom could be found. Darkness fell deeper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>around them. Every sail was set in the hope
that some breeze off the land might come
in time. Blue lights were burnt on deck,
that their friends on shore might know of
their danger.</p>

<p>Thunder muttered. Flashes of lightning
gleamed across the darkened sky. The white
surf loomed nearer and nearer; the ship rose
and fell on the backwash of the waves that
broke on the reef.</p>

<p>Nothing could save her, but lives must be
saved if possible. Seventy-two people were
packed into the three boats, and very soon
after the last one had left her side, the <i>John
Williams</i> struck the reef.</p>

<p>Rain poured down on the open boats as
they rowed sadly from the wreck. The landing-place
was some miles away, and the surf
was foaming wildly.</p>

<p>Earlier in the evening those on shore had
caught sight of the blue lights. Some had
run along the rocks to a point near the
wreck. As they ran, the natives kept up a
hooting cry that roused every one by the way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>It was eerie to hear their call through the
darkness and storm.</p>

<p>By the time the boats were trying to reach
the shore, fires and torches burned brightly
all round the bay to guide their rowers.</p>

<p>But no boat could reach the shore that
night. The poor drenched voyagers had to
leave their boats and get into canoes, then to
leave the canoes and be carried by natives
through the surf! In spite of all, they reached
land safely.</p>

<p>But it was with sad hearts that they looked
out across the bay at the wreck of their ship
during the days that followed.</p>

<p>At last, in spite of many other delays, more
than sixteen months after they had sailed from
England, Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers reached the
island of Rarotonga, where their home was
now to be. The natives there knew a little
English. As one of them carried Mr.
Chalmers ashore he turned to him and asked:</p>

<p>“What fellow name belong you?”</p>

<p>“Chalmers.”</p>

<p>Natives were crowding on the shore to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>the stranger and to hear who he was. The
man who carried him wished to be the first
to find out and to tell the others. But the
“Ch” and the “s” were too harsh for him
to say, so instead of “Chalmers,” he shouted,
“Tamate!” And Mr. Chalmers was called
“Tamate” to the end of his life. Mrs.
Chalmers was called “Tamate Vaine,” which
was the native way of saying “the wife of
Chalmers.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">RAROTONGA</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">R</span>AROTONGA is one of the fairest islands
in the world. It has a white sandy
beach; within that lies a belt of rich land.
On this land, and even on the lower slopes
of the mountains that tower one above the
other in the centre of the island, banana
trees, chestnuts, and cocoanut palms grow
in clumps.</p>

<p>Tamate and Tamate Vaine quickly settled
down to their work in Rarotonga. The life
there was very quiet after the constant
change and danger of the voyage.</p>

<p>The people who lived in Rarotonga called
themselves Christians. They had given up
fighting and the worship of the strange
wild spirits whom their fathers had thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>to be full of power. But though they had
done this, many of them were still selfish
and lazy.</p>

<p>Tamate would have liked to go at once
amongst men who were much wilder, and
who had never heard of the God who is
love.</p>

<p>When he saw what his work in Rarotonga
would be, he wrote to England to
those who had sent him. He asked them
to send some one else to Rarotonga, some
one who would like to work quietly and
to teach; and to let him go to a more
dangerous place, where he could make it
easier for others to follow him. But no one
else could be sent then, and he could not
leave his post.</p>

<p>When he found that he must stay in
Rarotonga, he made up his mind that
since he could not get the work he wished,
he would throw all his strength into the
work he had to do.</p>

<p>Part of it was to train native lads so
that they might become teachers and go to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>other islands. Though they were men, he
had to teach them a great many things
that boys and girls learn at home when they
are very little. He had to train them to be
thrifty, and tidy too, because, when they
went away to teach they would have to
till their own gardens, and to grow their
own crops, and to be at the head of a
school without any one to guide them.</p>

<p>As Tamate spoke to the people in church
Sunday after Sunday he wondered where
all the young men were. There were old
men and women, and young women and
children, and there were his students, but
he scarcely ever saw any other young men.</p>

<p>Where could they be?</p>

<p>He found that they spent their days, and
often their nights too, in the thick tanglewood
that is called “the bush,” and that they
drank orange beer there, and sometimes
foreign drinks too. These revels made
them useless for anything else.</p>

<p>The natives who knew Mr. Chalmers, and
were beginning to love him, begged him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>not to go near the young men when they
were drinking, because they were wild and
fierce, and might kill him.</p>

<p>But Tamate never was afraid of any one.
He went away alone, and plunged here and
there through the bush, until he came
upon a band of young men. Then he sat
down and chatted with them. Very soon
they liked him so much that though they
would not give up drinking, yet they could
forgive him when he knocked the bungs out
of the beer barrels and let the beer run
away. He was so brave and fearless that
he could do this when the men were
standing watching him.</p>

<p>Sometimes one or two of the young men
gave up drinking, but Tamate wished to get
hold of them all, not of one or two only, so
he kept on winning their friendship, and
waited.</p>

<p>His chance came. He heard that the
young men were meeting to drill for war,
and that they called themselves volunteers.
This was startling. War had ceased on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>island. No one was likely to attack them
from over the sea. Why should they drill?</p>

<p>Tamate thought of the battles of Glenaray.
He knew it would be useless to
talk to these wild lads about peace and
kindness, but he thought of another plan.
He said to them:</p>

<p>“Why do you drill out of sight like
this? Why not let every one see that you
are ‘Volunteers.’ You must come to
church, and sit together in the gallery.”</p>

<p>The first Sunday after that a few of
them came to church. The next week many
more came, and from that time the Sunday
Service became part of their drill. So
eager were they to look well when they
came to it, that they began to plant their
lands that they might sell the fruit they
grew, and buy clothes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="400" alt="Coral for the new staircase"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Coral for the new staircase</p>

<p class="gap">By-and-by the little church in Rarotonga
needed a new platform and a new staircase.
Then a great joy came to Tamate.
He saw his young bushmen, whom he had
first seen round their midnight fires, wild
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>and fierce and useless, away out on the
reefs cutting coral for the new staircase.
They had learned to love the church and
its services, and some of them became soldiers
in the army of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>When the church was ready to be
opened again, there was great eagerness
and stir. The natives had given nearly
all that was needed. But there was still £25
worth of wood unpaid for.</p>

<p>Tamate was sure that the gifts that
would be brought on the opening day would
be worth much more than £25, but when he
said so to a group of men, the doorkeeper
said to him:</p>

<p>“How are you going to get in?”</p>

<p>“Why, by the door, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, you will not. I have the keys, and
I will not open the door until everything is
paid. Of course you may try the windows.”</p>

<p>Tamate was very glad that his doorkeeper
cared so much about this debt. Though
he had not meant to be so strict, he yielded
to his friend.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p>But although the doorkeeper would let
no one enter a church that was not paid
for, he did not mean to keep any one out of
church for a single day.</p>

<p>Soon a great noise was heard in the
village. Boom went the drums. Boom!
boom! High above their booming the
voices of the villagers rose. Every one
was called together to give what they could
spare for the church. Very soon all was
paid, and many gifts were left over.</p>

<p>All the time that Tamate was in Rarotonga
he was longing to be at more
dangerous work amongst those who lived
to fight and kill each other, and who had
no one to teach them.</p>

<p>His thoughts were so much with these
wild tribes that he made others think of
them too. Many of his students had caught
his spirit, and longed, as he did, to go to
the island of New Guinea, where very wild
men lived and fought. Some of the teachers
he had trained went before him. They knew
it was dangerous, but they went with joy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>because they too had learned how great
and glad a thing it is to live for others.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Chalmers was allowed to
leave Rarotonga and to go to New Guinea.</p>

<p>New Guinea is an island three times as
large as Great Britain. It is very rich in
fruits, in ebony wood, and in other things
that traders like to find. It lies near
to Australia. But the savages who lived
in it were so fierce, and its rocky coast
was so wild, that no one had tried to trade
in the south-eastern end of it. Those who
knew anything about it thought that to go
there meant to die.</p>

<p>Four years before Tamate went to New
Guinea, some of his teachers had landed
at one of its villages, which was called
Port Moresby. Here they found Mr. Lawes
and his wife, who some months earlier had
made their home there. They were the
first white people who had lived amongst
the natives of that wild coast. They found
many tribes of natives, and each tribe was
at war with the tribes around it. If two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>chiefs had a quarrel with each other, they
brought their tribes to fight it out. Then
the two tribes went on paying each other
back in turn, till all their villages were
burned and very many of their warriors
were killed. Every one was either killing,
or being killed, or afraid of being killed.</p>

<p>The men of New Guinea were large and
strong, and they liked to look handsome.
They thought it very handsome to have
their hair standing far out on the tops of
their heads and all round, with beautiful
bright feathers stuck into it. They liked,
too, to wear sticks like tusks through their
noses, and rings through their ears, and
necklaces of bones.</p>

<p>They daubed themselves all over with
bright, sticky paint. But what they thought
most handsome of all was to have a great
many tattoo marks. When a man had killed
another he was allowed to have his skin
pricked with coloured dye. Afterwards the
dye would never come out, no matter how
hard the skin was scrubbed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p>No one was allowed to have these coloured
marks until he had killed a man. That was
why the wild men of New Guinea were so
proud of tattoo marks. Each mark proved
that the man who bore it had been strong
and clever.</p>

<p>It did not always prove that he had been
brave, because sometimes the spear that
had killed had been thrown from behind
the foe.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE DEATH OF BOCASI</p>

<p class="noindent gap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>AMATE was on his way to New
Guinea at last, and soon the ship in
which he sailed was within sight of the
island. But that did not mean that he
could land at once and begin his work
there. He had many things to think of.
He must choose a place where the reefs
would allow his boat, if he ever had one,
to anchor safely; and where any ships that
passed could come near enough to let him
get on board. He wished to be able to go
here and there along the coast, and to
open up many roads for others to follow.</p>

<p>He must also have firm ground on which
to build a house. The natives of New
Guinea could live in swamps. They chose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>great trees, cut off the branches and fixed
the stem deep in the mud. High up above
the swamp they built a platform across the
tops of the tree trunks, and then a house
on the platform. They clambered up to
their houses by palm-leaf ladders. Sometimes
their villages were built right out
into the sea, so that they could paddle
about in their canoes in and out underneath
their homes.</p>

<p>But though those who had been born in
New Guinea could live so, the hot, damp
air, and the smells which rose from the
swamps would have killed strangers.</p>

<p>Besides that, Tamate wished to teach
those he gathered about him to grow many
kinds of plants for food, so he had to
choose a place where the soil was good.</p>

<p>After a long time he sighted the island
of Suau, which looked as if it might be
the right place. It lay close to the
mainland.</p>

<p>In the bay beside it a single canoe paddled
about. There was only one man in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>canoe&mdash;a big, wild, cruel-looking native. He
was fishing. Though he was fierce and
strong, he was in terror when he saw the
ship. His fishing was forgotten, and he
paddled with all his might for the shore.</p>

<p>But the ship could sail much more
quickly than his canoe, and soon she overtook
him.</p>

<p>Tamate held up some bright beads and
a piece of iron, and offered to give them
to him, to show that he meant to be friends
and not to hurt him in any way. The man
waited to get the gifts, and then made off
to the shore, while the ship anchored in
the bay.</p>

<p>Very soon canoes came out to the vessel,
and dark figures clambered up her sides
and over her deck. They were very
curious to know what kind of a thing this
big “canoe” was, and to see the strange
white people on board; and they wished
to get beads and iron if they could!</p>

<p>Tamate Vaine sat knitting. And as the
natives looked at everything and every one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>they watched her too. She was the first to
win a friend; for there was one big savage,
called Kirikeu, who was so much charmed
by her and by her knitting that he did not
trouble to go with the others to see all that
was in the boat, but sat still and watched
her. They could not talk to each other at
all; but when at sunset time he knew that
he must go ashore, he made signs to her
that he would go away and sleep, and that
when morning came he would return with
a gift for her. He could not tell her what
the gift would be, but he showed her it
would be something to eat.</p>

<p>By the time the sun began to rise next
morning the canoes of Suau were ready to
paddle to the ship again. Leading all the
others was one in which Kirikeu sat with
the food he had said he would bring.</p>

<p>But although Kirikeu was friendly, all
the others were not. Many of them looked
as if they would be glad to pick a quarrel.
Their faces were frowning and angry.</p>

<p>Still, Tamate thought he would risk it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>From a sailor who had picked up a good
many of the words spoken on another island
which lay near, he had learned all that he
could. At many of the points at which he
had landed to look for a home, he had used
those words, but he found that no one
knew them. The tribes in New Guinea
speak many different languages. Here at
Suau he found that the natives did know
what he meant when he used the words
the sailor had taught him. This made him
more eager to stay. One other thing he
must have. That was good water. A
party from the ship landed. When Kirikeu
knew that they were looking for water, he
led them to a fresh stream.</p>

<p>Near the stream Tamate saw a piece of
land that he liked. He bought it from the
chief. Then he and his teachers began to
build a house. The natives followed him
into the woods, and he showed them which
trees he wished, and gave them tomahawks
with which to cleave the stems. They
thought this great fun. They did not do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>what he wished, because they cared for
him, nor because they meant to be friendly.
They were just like boys with new knives,
ready to cut anything. If they had not
been a little afraid of the white man, they
would have liked to kill him with the tomahawks,
and so get all the cargo in the ship.</p>

<p>Tamate and his wife lived in one end of
the chief’s house until their own was built.
They hired a room from him. It was a
strange room. The bed was spread on the
floor. It had no table, nor chair. A wall,
only two feet high, ran between it and the
room in which the chief lived. It was
startling, on wakening in the dim light
before the sun rose, to see bones and
skulls glimmering from the roof, and dark
figures passing through the room.</p>

<p>Houses do not take long to build when
they are quite simple, and are made of tree
stems and palm fronds. Soon the new
house was firm and strong. There was
very little in it, and the seats and tables
and beds were bare and plain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>Tamate was eager to get all his beads
and cloth into the house in order to let the
little ship that still lay in the bay sail
away. It was not easy to take this bulky
money from the boat to the house. Whenever
a native saw anything he wished to
have, he thought he would like to get it
at once, and asked for it. If it was not
given to him, he grew angry, and perhaps
he stole it when no one was at hand.</p>

<p>One afternoon a band of armed natives
passed Tamate. They were daubed with
war paint, and looked very terrible. They
carried their spears and clubs as if they
were ready to use them at any moment.
In spite of the daubs of paint, Tamate
knew that some of them were men who
had been friendly with him. He shouted a
greeting to them, but they frowned, and
hurried on to the chief’s house where the
teachers were. He hastened after them,
and went in amongst them. He found that
they were led by a chief from the mainland,
and that they wished gifts. The Suau chief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>round whose house they crowded, was very
angry. He talked and shouted to the
warriors from his platform. Then he called
to the teachers to bring guns. When he
saw that they would not do it, he rushed
in and seized one himself.</p>

<p>Tamate tried to calm his friend, and to
make him see that they would not fight,
because they had come to bring peace to
the island, not war.</p>

<p>The fierce-looking man whom they had
seen first in his canoe in the bay, ran at
Tamate with his club in the air.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Tomahawks, knives, iron, beads; and if
you do not give them to us we shall kill
you!”</p>

<p>“You may kill us, but never a thing will
you get from us.”</p>

<p>He had to hold to his word alone. The
teachers wished him to give the mainland
chief and his people some little things for
fear they would kill them all. But he
said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>
<p>“Can’t you see, if we give to these men,
others will come from all round and ask
gifts, and the end will be that we shall all
be killed. No; if they mean to kill us, let
them do it now, and be done with it!”</p>

<p>Then Kirikeu came, and begged him to
give something. By this time this first
Suau friend cared a great deal for the white
man, and wished to help him. He thought
it was the only way to get rid of the warriors.
But Tamate said:</p>

<p>“No, my friend, I never give to people who
carry arms.”</p>

<p>Then Kirikeu and the Suau chief began
to shout to the strangers again. At last
the wild yells came more seldom, and the
men from the mainland went with the men
of Suau into the bush to talk out the
quarrel. Once more they sent to ask for
a gift, and once more they were answered
as before:</p>

<p>“I never give to armed people.”</p>

<p>Next morning Kirikeu brought the mainland
chief to Tamate. Now the warrior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>was unarmed. The anger and fury of the
night before were gone. When he found
that he could not force the stranger to give
him anything, and that Kirikeu and the
Suau chief would not allow him to kill him,
he thought that the best thing to do was
to try to make peace, and this Tamate
gladly did.</p>

<p>While the others were building, Mrs.
Chalmers had been winning another friend.
A bold young warrior, named Bocasi, used
to sit beside her on the platform of the
chief’s house. He taught her to speak the
Suau words, and she taught him to knit.</p>

<p>Many other natives were becoming friendly
to the strangers. Sometimes they brought
gifts of vegetables and fish, and sometimes
they invited them to their feasts.</p>

<p>Tamate thought that he might leave his
teachers in charge at Suau for a short time,
and go, in the little ship that still lay in the
bay, to see some other villages along the
shore. He was very busy clearing out
some “bush” near the house, that he might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>get it planted before he went, when one of
the crew came to him, and said:</p>

<p>“I ’fraid, sir, our captain he too fast with
natives. One big fellow he come on board,
and he sit down below. Captain he tell
him get up. He no get up. Captain he
get sword, and he tell him if he no get up
he cut head off! He get up; go ashore.
I fear he no all right. Natives all look
bad, and he been off trying to make row
we fellow.”</p>

<p>Tamate knew that the “big fellow” was
Bocasi. He was vexed that he and the
captain had quarrelled, but he did not
think there was danger. He said to the
sailor:</p>

<p>“Oh no; I think it is all right.”</p>

<p>Then he told the men to stop work. As
he was paying them, he heard two shots
fired from the ship. He reached the
house with a bound. The ship was a small
one, not the one in which they had come
to Suau, but another which had stayed beside
them with cargo until they could land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>everything they needed. Its crew numbered
only four, and this morning the captain
and the cook had been left alone on
board. The other two were on shore, helping
to clear and to plant.</p>

<p>Whenever Tamate heard the shots, he
sent these two sailors off to their captain.
As he looked out to the ship, he saw
natives swarming all over her deck, and
some of them tugging at her anchor chain.
On a point of rock that ran out towards
the ship other dark figures crowded.</p>

<p>What could the captain be doing? Was
he going to let the men in the canoes carry
the line from his vessel to the wild crowd
on the rocks, that they might pull the little
ship ashore and wreck her?</p>

<p>Then a great noise rose from the beach,
where the ship’s boat lay, and the two
sailors came running back to say that
natives were in the boat, and would not
let it go back to the ship.</p>

<p>Tamate ran off, leaping over fences and
bushes till he reached the shore. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>sprang to the boat. The natives fled before
him, and soon the sailors were rowing hard
to reach the ship.</p>

<p>When the natives on board saw them
coming they took fright, slipped down into
their canoes, and made for the shore.
Those on the reef ran back to the village.
When the sailors reached the ship, they
found their captain lying on deck with a
spear-head in his side, and gashes on his
head and foot. They were so angry that
they began to fire at the crowd of natives
that surged backwards and forwards on
the shore. Two men were wounded. Tamate
did not know what to do first. He longed to
get to the ship to stop the firing, but for
the moment all he could do was to bandage
the wounds of the two natives. Meanwhile
the villagers were arming. Clubs and
spears seemed to spring from the ground on
every side. Angry voices asked, “Where is
Bocasi?” “Where is Bocasi?”</p>

<p>Bocasi had gone to the ship and had not
come back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Chalmers asked two native men to
take him in a canoe to the ship. He was
very anxious to know what had kept Bocasi.
He was too eager to wait till he was on
board, so he shouted when he came near&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is there still a man on board?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he board.”</p>

<p>Something about the voice of the man
who answered made Tamate’s heart sink.
He cried, “Is he shot?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he shot dead. Yes, he dead!”</p>

<p>When he got on board he found the
captain faint and white. Bocasi had tried
to kill the captain, and the captain had shot
Bocasi.</p>

<p>The captain might die of his wound. He
must be sent to some place where he could
be nursed. The body of Bocasi must be
taken to Suau. The people there were
angry already. When they saw the dead
body they would be full of fury. If Tamate
went back in the same canoe with it, they
would kill him in their first burst of wrath.
His wife and the teachers would be left at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>their mercy, and all his dreams of help for
the men of New Guinea would be over. If
he let the body go before him, his wife and
the teachers would be slain, and he would not
be allowed to land again.</p>

<p>One thing must be done first. By hook
or by crook he must get ashore before the
body. The canoe in which he had crossed
lay alongside. The men were just going to
place the body in it to row it to the shore.</p>

<p>“Stay,” he cried; “wait for a larger canoe
to carry Bocasi’s body.”</p>

<p>While they paused, he seized one native
who was still in the canoe, and said, “Take
me to shore quick, and give me time to
reach the house before you land the body.”</p>

<p>It was never easy to disobey Tamate, so
before the other native had time to object,
the little canoe was safely on its way to
the shore.</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers was grateful to reach his
house and to be amongst the men of Suau
again, but he knew that the hardest time
was still before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>When the dead body was brought to
land there was great mourning and wailing.
Bocasi was a warrior. He was young and
handsome, and his people were proud of
him.</p>

<p>The natives could not make up their
minds what to do. Now they carried their
weapons lowered for peace. Again they
strutted about with them raised for war.
East, and north, and west canoes could be
seen. They were all coming to Suau. From
each canoe as it touched the island a band
of armed men landed, joined the crowd and
added to the tumult. As the twilight fell,
Tamate sent out bandages and medicine to
the captain, and told him to be ready to sail
that night.</p>

<p>A party of natives came rushing to the
fence which ran round the bare new built
house.</p>

<p>“Come out and fight,” they shouted, “and
we will kill you for Bocasi.”</p>

<p>Then a chief came. “You must give
payment for Bocasi’s death,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I will give, but remember I have
had nothing to do with Bocasi’s death.”</p>

<p>“You must give it now.”</p>

<p>“I cannot. If you will come to-morrow
when the big star rises I will give it you.”</p>

<p>The chief went sulkily away.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a native stole out of the
bush. He did not speak angrily nor ask
for gifts. He had come on another errand.</p>

<p>“Tamate,” he said, “you must go to-night.
At midnight you may have a chance. To-morrow
morning when the big star rises
they will kill you.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have just come from the chief’s
house. That is what they have agreed.
They will do nothing till to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>Tamate told this to his wife, and asked
her if she wished to go away. Perhaps he
knew what she would say. At any rate she
answered as he would have done.</p>

<p>“We will stay. God will take care of us.
If we die, we die: if we live, we live.”</p>

<p>Then they asked the wives of the teachers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>They were brave too. They said, “Let us
live together or die together.”</p>

<p>That night they gathered quietly for
evening service in their strange new home.
They could not sing lest the sound should
bring the natives to attack them. Though
the teachers knew English, they were not
quite at home in it, so Tamate spoke in
Rarotongan, that they might follow every
word.</p>

<p>On the hush, broken only by his voice in
prayer, a grating sound fell. It was the
clank of the chain, on the side of the ship
and on the windlass, as the anchor was
drawn up.</p>

<p>When they rose from prayer and looked
out, the ship was leaving the bay. The
last chance of escape was gone. They were
alone amongst the fierce and angry natives.</p>

<p>Instead of going to sleep, Mr. and Mrs.
Chalmers spent the night making parcels.
They tied up large gifts for the near friends
of Bocasi and smaller ones for the others.</p>

<p>Through the darkness came the sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>of war-horns, and the shouts of bands of
fighters who came from the other side of
Suau and from the mainland. At four next
morning the chief strode in. He looked at
the gifts.</p>

<p>“It is not enough; can you not give more?”</p>

<p>“If you wait till the steamer comes I
may.”</p>

<p>“I must have more now.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you more now.”</p>

<p>Groups of natives came to the fence.
They shouted: “More, give more.”</p>

<p>But no notice was taken and they went
away. Daylight came, and still the new
house and those within it were unhurt.
Kirikeu wandered near the house.</p>

<p>“Let no one go out,” he said.</p>

<p>The day passed slowly, but still he kept
close to the house.</p>

<p>About three o’clock next morning Tamate
lay down to rest. But scarcely had he
fallen asleep when his wife roused him.</p>

<p>“Quick! They have taken the house.”</p>

<p>The door was only a piece of cloth hung
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>across the entrance. Tamate sprang to it
and drew aside the curtain. In front of
him a great band of armed men swayed.
Another party blocked the end of the house.
In the dim light the chief from the mainland
stood out as leader.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” shouted Tamate.</p>

<p>“Give us more, or we will kill you and
burn the house.”</p>

<p>“Kill you may, but no more payment do
I give. If we die we shall die fighting.”</p>

<p>The chief cowered in fear. The weapon
of the white man was uncanny and strange.
The courage of the white man alone against
them all was stranger still.</p>

<p>“Go!” said Tamate; “tell the others there
must be an end of this. The first man who
crosses the line where the fence stood is a
dead man. Go!”</p>

<p>And they went! They went and talked.
Talked wildly and fiercely too, but in less
than two hours Kirikeu came to say that
all was well.</p>

<p>On the shore they saw a large war-canoe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>ready to start, and watched the quick dark
figures of the natives as they lifted hundreds
of smaller canoes into the water.
The warriors from the mainland shouted
back: “We return to-morrow, to kill not
only the white man and his friends, but to
kill all of you.” But before to-morrow came
they thought they would stay at home!</p>

<p>The white man’s courage had awed the
natives, and though the chief of Suau would
have liked to get larger presents, he did
not wish the strangers to be killed. The
iron and beads they brought had made him
wealthy. When he saw that nothing would
move Tamate, he turned against the others.</p>

<p>“If you try to kill him,” he said, “you
must kill me first.”</p>

<p>That was why the mainland chief said
he would kill the men of Suau with the
strangers!</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE SPIRITS OF THE HEIGHT</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N time the natives grew friendly again.
Then Tamate thought of other places.
He had not come to New Guinea to teach
and help the people of one little island on
its shore only.</p>

<p>He wished to go here and there and
everywhere, that far and wide he might let
men know that he and those who followed
him meant peace and friendship. So he
would open the way. Later he would go
back to leave teachers with the chiefs whose
friendship he had won. In many villages
his students would have been killed at once
if they had gone alone. It needed a man
of strong courage, quick wit, and great
heart to go first. All these he had.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
<p>When he went away to make peace with
new tribes he would have liked to take his
wife with him, and she wished very much
to go. But she was as eager as Tamate
was to think of others first. She was a
strong woman. She did not say much, but
whenever she saw what was the right
thing to do she did it. She knew that
the teachers would be lonely if they both
went, and that the natives might not be
so willing to please them as they now
were to please her husband and herself.
So when Tamate went away she stayed at
Suau.</p>

<p>It was very hard to say good-bye, because
each of them knew that they might never
meet again, and that either of them might
need the other more than they had ever
needed any one.</p>

<p>One time it was more hard than it had
been before. Tamate wished to visit the
village of Tepauri. The tribe who lived
there were at war with Suau. In the last
battle the people of Suau had killed a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>many of the others. Tamate wished to make
peace between the two tribes.</p>

<p>One afternoon he said: “I am going to
Tepauri to-morrow; will you go with
me?” Even Kirikeu refused to go with
him.</p>

<p>That evening, as he and Mrs. Chalmers sat
at their door, a troop of natives came to them.
The dark men carried strange white things
in their arms. When they came near they
set them down in front of the house. They
were skulls! Kirikeu spoke for the others.
He said: “Friend, are you going over there
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean to go.”</p>

<p>“Do you see these skulls? They belonged
to people we killed from over there. They
have not been paid for. They will take
your head in payment, for you are our great
friend!”</p>

<p>He looked hard at Tamate and added:
“Will you go now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go to-morrow morning, and
God will take care of us.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>
<p>Beni, a Rarotongan teacher, was a widower.
Tamate said to him: “You heard all the
natives said yesterday. I am going to Tepauri.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>He agreed, and the two went off together.
When they reached Tepauri they found
themselves in the midst of a wild dancing
mob. The natives shouted and waved their
spears and their clubs, and made believe
to throw them.</p>

<p>Every now and again they cried: “Goira,
Goira.”</p>

<p>This sounded like a Rarotongan word
which meant “spear them.” The natives
caught Tamate’s hand and rushed along the
shore with him. The teacher was forced to
follow close behind, and still the men of
Tepauri danced and shouted and aimed their
spears at unseen foes.</p>

<p>They came to the bed of a stream. Tamate
stuck his heel against a stone to try to stop
himself, but he was lifted over it and on and
on, stumbling and running and clambering
up the stony bed. He turned to Beni and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>said, “Try to get back. They may let
you go.”</p>

<p>“I am trying all the time.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are taking us to the sacred
place to kill us!”</p>

<p>“It looks like it.”</p>

<p>The thick undergrowth was so close and
tangled that there was no hope of escape
into it.</p>

<p>“No use,” said Tamate. “God is with us,
so let us go quietly.”</p>

<p>From the dry stones of the stream bed
and the thick bush, they came to a beautiful
cool pool of water, hung round with ferns
and moss. Then one of the men who had
dragged them along made a speech. They
did not know all the words then, but they
could gather the meaning of the whole.
This is part of it.</p>

<p>“Tamate, look, here is good water. It
is yours and all this land is yours. Our
young men will begin at once to build you
a house. Go and bring your wife and leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>these bad murdering people you are with,
and come and live with us.”</p>

<p>“Goira” was their word for water.</p>

<p>When Tamate and Beni returned to Suau
the natives there could not believe that the
people of Tepauri had not hurt them. They
looked at them anxiously and said:</p>

<p>“They did not kill you, but did you eat
anything there?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, plenty.”</p>

<p>“You should not have done that. They will
have poisoned you.”</p>

<p>When the natives of Suau saw that Tamate
Vaine stayed alone with them when her husband
went away, they were delighted. They
said to each other:</p>

<p>“They trust us, we must treat them kindly.
They cannot mean us harm, or Tamate would
not have left his wife behind.”</p>

<p>They used to beg her to eat a great deal,
so that her husband would know that they
had treated her well.</p>

<p>But the fever that seizes so many people
there had weakened Mrs. Chalmers. Her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>spirit was so brave and strong that neither
she nor any one else knew how ill she
was.</p>

<p>Once Tamate went for a long walk on the
mainland across the water from Suau. He
wished to find out if it would be wise to send
teachers far inland amongst the mountains.
On this walk an old chief was leader of the
party. They needed him to show them the
way across the mountains, but the chief was
eager to help in other ways that seemed to
him more useful.</p>

<p>It was a bright sunny morning when they
set out, and merry laughter and shouts rose
from the travellers. Soon they came to a
spot where a woman had died. The laughter
died away. With solemn faces the chief and
his men tore down branches from the trees
and ran on brushing their feet with the
branches, to keep the spirit of the dead
woman from tripping them up. When they
passed that bit of road, the run quieted down
to a walk. Then rain began to fall. Again
the chief took the care of the journey on his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>head. He scolded the rain and bade it be
gone.</p>

<p>They spent the night in a little village.
Tamate tried to sleep, but ever through his
sleep he heard his guide’s voice telling of the
strange doings of the white man and of the
great “war-canoe” that had called at Suau.</p>

<p>Next morning the chief gathered all the
party together on an island in the midst of
a stream. The way for the day lay uphill,
but ere the climb began, the spirits that lived
in the heights had to be made friendly. A
great leaf was laid on the ground. An old
cocoanut was scraped into it. Other leaves
were cut into little pieces and mixed with the
cocoanut, while the chief and five others sat
on the ground and sang a low chant. Then
they sprang up suddenly with a shout, and
the natives squeezed some of the juices of the
leaves and cocoanut over their heads. But
this was not all. They waded into the stream
and stood in deep water with their eyes
gazing at the mountain-tops and their hands
on their mouths. A low murmur reached the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>ears of those who watched them from the
island. Suddenly another shout rose, and
the sound of splashing water as the men
plunged into the stream. The chief was the
last to return to the island. Tamate asked
him:</p>

<p>“Is it all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very good. The mountain spirits
have gone, and the chief on the other side
will be ready for us. We shall eat pigs. We
shall put on armlets. And more food will be
given to us than we shall know what to do
with.”</p>

<p>All the way up the chief was very solemn.
He would pluck a leaf, talk to it, throw it
away and pluck another. A bird on a twig
before him was enough to bar the way. He
bade it be gone, and stood motionless till he
saw it fly.</p>

<p>The walk was a happy one, but Tamate felt
that there were many other parts of New
Guinea that were more in need of teachers,
so he did not place any there then.</p>

<p>When he returned to Suau he found his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>wife very ill, and in a few months he had to
let her sail away to Sydney. She could not
get well at Suau, but they both hoped that
rest and change in Australia would make her
strong again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo4"><img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="400" alt="Another shout rose"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Another shout rose</p>

<p class="gap">He worked on at Suau, but the letters from
Sydney brought him sad news. His wife was
growing weaker instead of stronger. A few
months after she had left him a friend came
to help him, and he gladly left this friend in
charge at Suau and sailed for Sydney, but
ere he reached his wife, he read in a newspaper
that she was dead. She died amongst
loving friends. She was bright and strong
to the end, and her thoughts were full of
others’ needs. One of her last messages to
her husband was:</p>

<p>“Do not leave the teachers.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers sailed back to New Guinea
to find a new home and new work at Port
Moresby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph2">KONE</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ORT MORESBY is a village on the
mainland of New Guinea. It lies to
the north and west of the island of Suau.
Here Mr. Chalmers made his new headquarters
beside Mr. and Mrs. Lawes.
Together they planned and began the working
of a training-school that they might
have New Guinean teachers.</p>

<p>Tamate used to say that to do Christ’s
work in New Guinea one was needed to
break up the ground, another to sow, and
another to reap. Although during his lifetime
he saw many of the fierce men of the
islands won for Christ, and trying to live
as He wishes men to live, still the greater
part of his work was to break down the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>hatred and cruelty of the wildest tribes.
So, though he had his house at Port
Moresby, he was seldom there for any
length of time.</p>

<p>On one of his voyages westward along
the coast he sighted three canoes. The
men in the canoes were waiting to trade
with natives from the village of Namoa.
When they saw Tamate they all went
ashore and ate together on the beach.
Still there was no sign of the Namoans.</p>

<p>“Why not walk to Namoa?” said one.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“And Tamate will come too!”</p>

<p>He did not wish to go. He was on his
way to a village farther west. But the
others were very eager to have him with
them, and he yielded. As they started he
looked round doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I fear it will rain before we can get
back,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not till we return,” answered a native
woman.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>“The rainmaker is with us, and he only
can bring rain!”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>The woman pointed to a chief named
Kone.</p>

<p>“What about rain, Kone?”</p>

<p>“It cannot rain, so do not fear.”</p>

<p>“But I think it will rain.”</p>

<p>“You need not fear; let us start.”</p>

<p>As they walked he said again:</p>

<p>“Kone, it will rain!”</p>

<p>“It will not,” Kone said. Then he turned
to the mountains and shouted:</p>

<p>“Rain, stay on the mountains! Rain,
stay on the mountains!”</p>

<p>“No use, Kone; rain will come.”</p>

<p>Soon the rain began to fall in torrents.</p>

<p>Kone thought that Tamate had brought
the rain by stronger magic than he himself
could use. He said:</p>

<p>“You are a great chief, and so am I, but
the rain has listened to you.”</p>

<p>“Come, my friend, I have told you of the
great and good Spirit and of His power.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>
<p>But Kone only laughed.</p>

<p>The kindly Namoans made the strangers
welcome. They feasted them in their
clubhouse till the rain was over and the
stars shone on the white chief and the
dark natives, who gazed with awe on the
man who had brought rain in spite of
Kone.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Chalmers often met the
rainmaker, who loved to sit and listen while
the white chief told of the fierce men who
lived towards the sun-setting, and of the way
in which he had brought peace amongst
many of them. Kone offered to visit him
at Port Moresby. Tamate was amused.
He thought it was only in order to get
tobacco and tomahawks and beads that
Kone meant to come. Kone did wish to
get these things, but the thought of peace
had got into his mind, and he had begun
to love his new friend greatly too.</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers wished to place a teacher
in the village of Delena, where Kone’s home
was. So he stayed there for some time to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>take charge of the building of a house and
to prepare for a school.</p>

<p>One night he saw that all his friends in
the village were excited. They feared an
attack from the Lolo tribe, who lived near.
Natives moved quickly hither and thither.
Women glided past and were lost in the
bush. They carried bundles. Soon they
returned with empty hands. They had hid
their treasures. Natives came to him.
They whispered to him and pointed to his
guns.</p>

<p>“Shoot, Tamate. Shoot for us, and
frighten the Loloans and send them
away.”</p>

<p>In the simplest words he tried to tell
them that he had not come to scatter
people, but to gather all together. To
bring peace; to change foes into friends.</p>

<p>The troubled natives did not know what
he meant. To-night they spoke to this
great white chief. To-morrow he and they
might be lying dead, and yet he would not
shoot!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>
<p>They could not understand him, but sometimes
a glimmer of what he wished flashed
on them, and they turned away with a
half hope that he would save them some
other way if he would not save them by
his gun.</p>

<p>On the night of the attack Tamate fell
asleep. He was content to trust to the
quick ears of his little terrier or the ready
alarm of his boy. Beyond the tents great
lights were burning, so that no one could
steal up unseen.</p>

<p>At two in the morning the alarm came.
On every side there was noise and clamour.
Tamate’s tent was high above the village.
Women and children flocked to it. They
tumbled over each other in their eagerness
to get into safety and to save their
pots and ornaments. In spite of all that
Tamate had said, they still hoped that he
would use his guns!</p>

<p>Bundles of arrows and spears were carried
into the bush and left there in hiding,
so that if a warrior had thrown his last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>spear he had only to dodge into the tanglewood
and come out terrible as before! At
last the fighting began.</p>

<p>The natives once more urged Tamate to
shoot.</p>

<p>“Come down and fight,” they shouted.</p>

<p>He left the women and children in the
care of his boy, and hurried down to the
village. He had no gun, no spears, no
arrows. But he had no fear. He came
straight up to the warriors and shouted:
“Peace!”</p>

<p>Then the sharp twang of the bow-strings
ceased, and the hiss of the spears and
arrows came more seldom, till a hush fell
over all.</p>

<p>Tamate asked one man after another to
give up his arms. And they did. Kone
was at his side, and whispered to him:</p>

<p>“Yonder is the Loloan chief.”</p>

<p>Tamate had met this chief before and had
not been able to win his friendship. He
must try again! He went to him, and somehow
or other the next thing that happened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>was that he and the warrior chief were
walking arm-in-arm to the tents. It sounds
very funny to read about, but it was very
serious that morning.</p>

<p>The Loloan chief promised to stop the
fighting, and Tamate let him return to his
men. But very soon some of the villagers
came rushing up, shouting, “They will kill
Kone! They will kill Kone!”</p>

<p>Tamate ran into the fight again. Many
more Loloans had come. They danced
wildly round in their war paint. Clubs and
spears rattled and whizzed on every side.
One blow fell on his head, another on his
hand. An old friend drew him to the
edge of the fight. The Loloan chief came
to him.</p>

<p>“We will not hurt you; let us fight it
out,” the chief begged.</p>

<p>“No, no; you must stop, and see that you
do not hurt my friend Kone.”</p>

<p>When quiet came at last, Mr. Chalmers
told them all, that he could not stay with
them if they fought so, and that if they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>wished to have him there, they must not
kill each other.</p>

<p>After the Loloans were gone, the men of
Delena gathered round him to thank him.</p>

<p>“If you had not been here,” they said,
“many of us would have been dead, and the
others away from their homes for ever.”</p>

<p>While Tamate stayed at Delena, he had
a short service each day at sunrise, and
another at sunset. At first the natives
came to see what the strange white man
did. Afterwards they began to care for
what he said. They found that this strong
chief, who had brought rain when they did
not wish it, and peace when they did wish
it, cared very much about the words he
spoke at sunrise and at sunset. They could
see it. His face glowed. The man who
had been calm when the arrows flew about
him, grew excited when he spoke of his
Master Jesus Christ. So they wondered
and listened. But Kone waited when the
others went away. He wished to know
more. Tamate taught him a prayer: “Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>Spirit of Love, give me light! Lead me to
Christ, for Jesus’ sake.”</p>

<p>It is very simple, but it was not easy for
Kone to learn it. Every now and then a
smile came to Tamate’s lips. He saw the
rainmaker on his way from the village. He
knew why he was coming and what he
would say.</p>

<p>“Tamate, I have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>Then he learned it again, and went off
gladly, only to come back in a little while
and say, “I have forgotten it, Tamate.”</p>

<p>But before the house was built Kone had
learned that prayer, so that he could never
forget it.</p>

<p>Not long after Mr. Chalmers left Delena
a great feast was held there. Kone’s heart
was full of love to his white friend who had
saved him from death and had brought
peace because he knew the great Spirit
of Love. Kone, too, wished to bring peace.
He would help Tamate’s work and end
the strife between the Loloans and the
Naara tribe with whom they were at war.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>He thought the feast would be a good time
to begin, so he asked two Naara men to
come to Delena for it.</p>

<p>As the dancing began, he saw a Loloan
steal up behind one of his Naara friends.
The Loloan’s spear was aimed at the
stranger. There was no time for Kone to
save his guest except in one way. He
leapt in front of his friend, and the spear
that was meant for the Naara man entered
his own breast. He was carried home to
die.</p>

<p>“Send for Tamate,” he said, “send for
Tamate.” But across the reef and up
against the shore a great south-east wind
was blowing, and no canoe could face the
wildness of the sea.</p>

<p>In the darkness of pain and weakness,
Kone could not have the joy of seeing
his friend once more. But still in the shadow
of death he sought for Tamate’s Master,
and murmured the words he had learned
so slowly: “Great Spirit of Love, give me
light! Lead me to Christ.”</p>

<p class="caption">The spear entered his own breast</p>

<p class="gap"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
<p>A few months later, Mr. Chalmers came
back to Delena. He wished to go still
farther west, and meant to take Kone with
him. Kone was a good fellow-traveller. He
could speak many languages, he was loved
by the natives, and he was a constant joy
to Tamate. The great childlike heart of
the savage chief was like his own.</p>

<p>When the boat reached Delena, a canoe
came out to meet her. But there were no
shouts of welcome, and Kone was not there.</p>

<p>A chief stepped on board in silence, and
at first would give no answer to the eager
question, “Where is Kone?” Then he said,
“Oh, Tamate, your friend Kone is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Kone is dead, and we buried him
at your house. The house of his one great
friend!”</p>

<p class="ph2">THE BERITANI WAR-CANOES</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">“T</span>AMATE” was the name by which the
Rarotongans called Mr. Chalmers
when he first reached the island. The
natives of New Guinea called the British
men-of-war “Beritani war-canoes.” While
Mr. Chalmers was at Port Moresby five of
them came to New Guinea, and sailed about
in its waters. Up till this time the south-eastern
part of the island had always been
left in the hands of the natives. If these
men had been as able to keep away other
people as they were to kill each other, it
might have been left to them always. But
although they were very clever with their
bows and spears, they could do little against
men who fought them with guns.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Chalmers and Mr. Lawes, and those
like them, were not the only foreigners
who came to New Guinea. Some very
cruel men came. They wished to make a
great deal of money, and they did not care
how much they hurt other people in order
to make it.</p>

<p>When they came to the island they bought
land as Tamate did, but they did not pay
for it as he had done. Sometimes they
bought a large piece of ground, and gave
the worth of one penny for it. The natives
did not know what their land was worth,
so they were willing to let it go for almost
nothing. The strangers did not always take
trouble to find out who really owned the
land. They bought it from those who had
no right to sell it.</p>

<p>But they did a very much more cruel
thing than that. They tempted the natives
to go away with them to work and to get
many things they wished in payment for the
work. The traders made the natives think
they meant to bring them back in “three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>moons.” Some of the men of New Guinea
thought it would be nice to come home
rich men in so short a time, and went with
them. But three months, and six months,
and a year passed, and still they did not
return. Their friends at last mourned for
them as dead, and gave the things that had
been theirs to others. Often the natives
were so angry, when they found out what
had been done, that they killed other white
men who did not wish to harm them.</p>

<p>Tamate had been in New Guinea for some
years. By his kindness to the natives, he
had made it more possible for strangers to
trade there. But many sad things were
happening. White men were cruel to
natives, and natives were cruel to white
men. Often both white men and dark
killed people who had not hurt them, because
they hated the whole race for what
single men of it had done.</p>

<p>Every one who knew about it felt that this
must not go on, and England sent her men-of-war
to take Southern New Guinea under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>her care. She did not take it for her own.
She only said that she would try to keep
people from doing very wicked things there,
and that she would punish those who were
unjust and cruel to others, whether they
were natives of New Guinea or not.</p>

<p>But the officers on board the men-of-war
did not know the languages of New Guinea.
They could not tell the natives why they
were there nor what they wished to do.
They asked Mr. Chalmers and Mr. Lawes
to go with them to let the natives know
why it was that the “Beritani war-canoes”
had sailed to New Guinea.</p>

<p>One day all the chiefs that could be
brought together from the tribes near, met
on board the war-ship <i>Nelson</i> in the bay
outside of Port Moresby. They feasted
there together, and then returned to the
village. But the doings of the day were
not over. Two of the big guns began to
fire, and the natives danced with surprise.
When darkness fell, search-lights gleamed
and glanced round the bay. They fell on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>the far-off mountains and on the palm
groves, and lighted up each creek and
cranny on the shore. They fell on the
quaint houses of Port Moresby, and on
the dark faces of the startled natives.
Then came the shriek of the syren. It
leapt about like an uncanny thing, and
seemed to come now from the plashing
waves and now from the depths of the
forest. Dogs and men fled alike from the
noise of it into the darkest corners of their
homes. Then the quiet of night fell on the
village and on the “Beritani war-canoes.”</p>

<p>Next morning the officers of H.M.S.
<i>Nelson</i> landed and marched to Mr. Lawes’
house. Hundreds of black eyes watched
them, and hundreds of ears listened with
delight to the music of the band.</p>

<p>The Union Jack was hoisted close to
the house. After that Commodore Erskine
read a paper, which told what Britain
would do for New Guinea, and what she
wished New Guinea to do for her.</p>

<p>The chiefs did not know what the Commodore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
read, but Mr. Lawes said it all
over to them in their own language.</p>

<p>Though Commodore Erskine was there
in order to tell the men of New Guinea
what Britain wished, he could not be long
with Mr. Chalmers and Mr. Lawes without
caring about their work too.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when his ship was in the
bay, he came ashore to see the school.
The village bell began to ring. It did not
hang in a church tower, nor over the door
of the school, but from the branch of a
tree. One hundred and twenty boys and
girls pattered into a long cool room. The
walls and roof were made of plaited palm
leaves, and the air could get in while the
hot sunshine had to stay outside. The
children answered many questions. They
knew where their own home lay on the
map, and they thought of other places
as near it, or far from it, for New Guinea
was the centre of the world to them.</p>

<p>They sang “Auld Lang Syne,” and “God
Save the Queen,” and afterwards they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>bowed their heads, and said, “Our Father
which art in heaven.” They did not say it
in words that Commodore Erskine knew,
but with reverence and trust which are the
same all over the world.</p>

<p>The Commodore would have liked to give
the children sweets and chocolates, but he
gave them something that they liked much
better. Each of them bounded away with
a string of beads, a bit of tobacco, and a
fish-hook!</p>

<p>At many other villages in New Guinea
the people were told why the “Beritani
war-canoes” had come to their shores, and
why the Union Jack was hoisted.</p>

<p>At one place there was great joy because
one of the war-ships brought back seventeen
men who had been tempted away by
traders. One was a chief, an older man
than most of those who had gone. He sat
gazing from the ship while a canoe came
from the shore. The two men in it climbed
up into the ship. Then there was a rush
and a cry, and the three natives were together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
One of the men in the boat was the
brother of the old chief. He had thought he
would never see him again, and now they
were together, weeping and rubbing noses,
which was their way of kissing.</p>

<p>But although the villagers were glad to see
their friends again, some were full of sorrow.
Many had gone away and only seventeen
had been brought back. They gathered
round Tamate and said:</p>

<p>“Where are the other boys? You have
brought joy to some homes, but others are
left in sorrow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers wished them to go with him
on the war-ship to tell Commodore Erskine
of their friends. The <i>Nelson</i>, on which the
Commodore sailed, was then at another part
of the island. But the natives were far too
frightened to go. One, who had a son away,
was willing to give anything he had if the
ships would only go quickly to bring back
his boy.</p>

<p>“Now go to-day, and we will fill the ship
with pigs,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Well, come and see the Commodore and
tell him you want your son back.”</p>

<p>“No! white fellow speak three moons, no
bring him again. You go bring fellow boy
back.”</p>

<p>The screw gave a sudden turn. The
native darted overboard into his canoe. He
thought he was going to be carried off by
force. When he saw the water rippling
between his canoe and the great war-ship,
he shouted:</p>

<p>“Bring boy back!”</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">TAMATE AND ANOTHER</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER this Mr. Chalmers went to England.
While he was there he met the
lady who afterwards became his wife. With
this second Tamate Vaine he made a home
at Motu-motu, the village of islands, a place
still farther west and nearer the country of
the wildest tribes of New Guinea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chalmers entered into her husband’s
work with great spirit. She soon loved the
wild villagers, and the chiefs from the country
round her home. And the little dark-skinned
children were a joy to her. But the climate
told on her health, and her husband sailed
with her to Sydney that the voyage and
rest might strengthen her.</p>

<p>At this time there was another great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>Scotchman on an island in the Pacific. He,
too, was trying to help those amongst whom
he lived, though not in the same ways that
Tamate helped. His name was Robert Louis
Stevenson. He wrote delightful stories and
poems, “Treasure Island” and “Kidnapped”;
“Leerie” and “The Land of Counterpane,”
and very many more.</p>

<p>When he was a full-grown man he enjoyed
romping just as much as Mr. Chalmers had
enjoyed being a bear in Cheshunt College.
These two men were like each other in many
ways, and when they met on board the
steamer from Sydney to the islands, they
became friends at once.</p>

<p>There was a little smoking-room on board
ship, and night after night the dim air was
full of pictures, pictures of shipwrecks and
strange weird places, of wild men in battle,
and little children. They were the pictures
that rose as one story followed another.</p>

<p>Too soon the steamer reached Samoa,
where Mr. Stevenson’s home was. The
friends had not to part at once. Tamate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>stayed some days in the island, but he was
so busy seeing people and speaking that
there was not much time for story-telling.
Twenty-four years before this, after the ship-wreck
at Savage Island, he had landed at
Samoa with nothing except the clothes he
wore. He had made friends there as he
always did, and now many of them, as well
as others who had only heard of him before,
wished to see him.</p>

<p>A great open-air meeting was held. Hundreds
and hundreds of native men and women
gathered to listen to him and to their own
King Malietoa.</p>

<p>The white people who lived there wished to
hear him too. They asked him to lecture to
them. This he did, and Robert Louis Stevenson
was in the chair at the meeting.</p>

<p>When Tamate sailed away from Samoa he
hoped soon to see his new friend, but they
could never meet again. The letters they
wrote to each other were full of love and
honour. In one of them Mr. Stevenson
said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p>“O Tamate, if I had met you when I
was a boy, how different my life would have
been!”</p>

<p>It was not only the wild men of New
Guinea who loved Mr. Chalmers. Wherever
he went he drew out all that was finest in
men and women, and made them better and
gladder because he was there.</p>

<p>When he and his wife reached Motu-motu
the sea was very rough and they could
scarcely land. But they were so eager to be
amongst their friends there again, that they
would not wait for calm. The little landing-boat
lay alongside, but far down below the
deck, and she danced on the waves like a
cork. It was too wild to think of a
ladder, so Mrs. Chalmers called out:</p>

<p>“Stand ready to catch hold of me, boys,
and when she rises again, I’ll spring.”</p>

<p>Her husband said:</p>

<p>“That’s the only way; but I fear you won’t
do it in time.”</p>

<p>But before he had finished speaking
Tamate Vaine found herself safely in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>boat, not very sure how she had got there,
but glad to be one step nearer home.</p>

<p>What a greeting met them. Every one was
at the water’s edge to welcome them home.
The houseboys came as far out as they could
on a bank of sand and ran alongside as the
boat came in, and the dogs plashed into the
water in their delight.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph2">THE CHARMS OF AVEO</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>Y this time Tamate and Tamate Vaine
had friends in hundreds of homes in
New Guinea. The teachers from Rarotonga
had grown into strong, good men and women.
Their love for Tamate was like the love of
children to a father. The little girls and boys
at the village schools rushed to welcome the
great white chief and his wife, and shrieked
with laughter when they tried to speak the
strange words of new tribes.</p>

<p>Many natives too had learned to love
Tamate’s Master. All life was changed for
them because Tamate had come to New
Guinea, and they felt for him a love that
was deeper and stronger than their love
for life. Often they went with him when
they thought it was to death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>But Tamate had other friends, men who
thought they knew better than he did, and
who still worshipped cruel spirits as their
fathers had done. Very many of them were
true friends to Tamate, and found a big
place in his heart and life. He loved them
for their own sakes, and he loved them
because he hoped that one day they too
would love his Master.</p>

<p>When Tamate left Motu-motu, Aveo was
one of these friends. He lived at a very
wild place farther west than Motu-motu.</p>

<p>Aveo was a great chief, but he seemed
much more than a chief to the people who
knew him. He had charms, and they thought
that the strange spirit they feared was in
him, and that he could make famines and
storms and earthquakes. They feared that
he would use his charms against them unless
they gave him many gifts. When their
canoes were lying deep in the water laden
with sago, and they were ready to sail away,
they gave arm shells and pigs to him and
asked him to give them calm weather!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>
<p>Tamate’s first visit to Aveo was a strange
one. He had heard much about the charms,
and he wished to see them. Aveo had seen
him before and was eager to welcome him.
He made a feast. While the food was
being cooked they sat and talked. Tamate
asked about the charms. He found that
Aveo believed in them himself as thoroughly
as other natives did.</p>

<p>“Let me see those charms, Aveo.”</p>

<p>“Tamate,” said Aveo, “you are now my
friend. If I showed you these things you
would die. No one but myself must see
them.”</p>

<p>“Aveo, there is no chance of my dying or
even being sick by seeing your things.”</p>

<p>“Never, my friend Tamate, never.”</p>

<p>“It is all right, Aveo, they can do me no
harm.”</p>

<p>A native who was listening said, “You
may let him see them. They will not hurt
him. He goes everywhere and sees everything,
and he is all right.”</p>

<p>Aveo sighed and looked strangely at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>Tamate. Then he said, “I am afraid, but
I will think about it.”</p>

<p>At night Tamate lay down to sleep. His
hammock was slung on the platform of a
village house. He was very tired, but when
he lay down he could not sleep. The night
was hot and the air heavy. Strange noises
rose to his ears from the other houses of
the village and from the wild bush all round.
About midnight another noise sounded
through those vague ones. It was the
sound of the fall of a naked foot on the
palm fronds of the platform. It came nearer
and nearer. Then a hand touched him and
a voice whispered:</p>

<p>“Are you asleep?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not. Is it you, Aveo?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do you really wish to see those
things?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure they won’t kill you? Will
you not get sick and then die after you
have seen them?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>
<p>“I am afraid, greatly afraid, but come
with me!”</p>

<p>Tamate slipped from his hammock and
followed Aveo in and out through the village,
till they came to the last house. It was
built on the ground, not on stilts like the
other houses. Aveo led the way, first
through one room, then through another,
till they came to a very small room in which
a low fire burned.</p>

<p>When they were both inside it, Aveo put
up a door across the opening by which they
had entered, so that no one could see into
the room. Then he piled wood on the
flickering fire and soon the flames flashed
up and lighted the dark corners and the two
dim figures.</p>

<p>Then Aveo fetched a netted bag. It was
small and dirty, but he handled it with great
care. He opened the bag a little. Then he
stopped.</p>

<p>“That must be enough, Tamate. You
will die if I go on, and what then will I
do?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>
<p>“No, Aveo, I will not die, so do not fear.”</p>

<p>Then Aveo took out a parcel. It was
bound up with fibres of cocoanut and native
cloth made of bark. Tamate watched and
watched. He began to think there was
nothing except string and cloth. The logs
were smouldering and everything was dim
again. Tamate stirred the fire. A blaze
lit up the room. Aveo stopped unwinding
the fibre, and looked at Tamate. He could
not see him well, for his eyes were full of
tears, and tears were on his cheeks. His
hands shook as he held the little parcel.
He faltered, “O Tamate, you will die.”</p>

<p>“No, Aveo, no; I am all right. Go on.”</p>

<p>Then the last bit of cloth was unrolled,
and Aveo put three little pieces of wood on
the mat. The light from the logs fell on
them. They looked like two little dolls and
a tiny club. They were very old. Only one
man could use them at a time. Long, long
ago a father had given them to his son. He
had told his son that his father had given
them to him. Then the son had given them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>to his son. No one knew how old they were.
No one had heard of a time when they had
not been handed down from a father to a
son. No one living had seen them except
Aveo and Tamate.</p>

<p>Tamate wished to buy them, but Aveo
would not sell them. He put them carefully
away again. Then Tamate said to him,
“Some day a man will come to live in your
village. He will tell you of the God who
made all things, and who loves us. After
that you will not want these things any
more. Promise that you will not sell them
except to me.”</p>

<p>Aveo smiled, for he was sure he would
always wish to keep his charms. He said,
“Yes, should it ever happen! I will give
these things to my son when I have taught
him all.”</p>

<p>Then Tamate found his way back to his
hammock and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Aveo came to him another night. This
time he brought his sleeping-mat with him.
His white friend was going away next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>morning, and Aveo wished to sleep beside
him, or rather to stay beside him, for he
did not try to sleep. He talked eagerly of
a voyage he had made to Motu-motu and
of the kindness that Mr. and Mrs. Lawes
had shown him. All at once he stopped
and began to sing to himself sadly.</p>

<p>Tamate said, “Aveo, what are you doing?
Why have you left off your story so suddenly?”</p>

<p>Aveo pointed to the north. “When I see
those two stars,” he said, “I always do this.
My father taught me. I know the spirit of
the sea hears me. May I go on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on.”</p>

<p>After the song was over, Aveo told Tamate
about the spirits of the earth and the sea
and the sky, till morning came.</p>

<p>When Tamate left Motu-motu to go far
west to the wildest tribes of all, who lived
near the Fly River, Aveo still trusted in his
charms and in his songs to the spirits of
the earth and sky and sea.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, Tamate came back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>from the Fly River to see his old friends
and to cheer the teachers who lived in the
villages along the shore. When he reached
the village where Aveo lived, the news of
his coming spread quickly, and Aveo hurried
to the teacher’s house to see his old friend.
After they had greeted each other, Aveo said,
“What about those things, Tamate?”</p>

<p>“What things?”</p>

<p>“Why, have you forgotten them?”</p>

<p>Then suddenly the white man remembered
the night he had spent in Aveo’s village
long ago, and the magic charms he had
seen there.</p>

<p>“I remember them well,” he said; “what
of them?”</p>

<p>“Do you want them now?”</p>

<p>“Yes; will you sell them to me?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no payment, Tamate. At night
when no one is about I will bring them to
you.”</p>

<p>At night Aveo came creeping in. He
peered all round. He saw two men looking
in at a door. They had been watching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>Tamate as he wrote. Aveo wished no
one to see. He said, “Send these men
away.”</p>

<p>When he saw that all the windows
and doors were shut, he opened his bag
and unwound the parcel as before. It was
not so eerie as it had been in his own
little room, with the gleaming logs.</p>

<p>Although Aveo no longer used his charms
it was not easy for him to part with them,
and Tamate was so much afraid that he
would be sorry and ask them back again,
that whenever he got the bag with its
strange little dolls, he hurried down to his
ship that lay at anchor near the shore. He
could talk more happily with Aveo, when he
knew that the charms were safely locked up
on board.</p>

<p>Next morning Mr. Chalmers set sail for
another village. There was a heavy sea
rolling, and the little ship was driven against
a point of rock. Although Aveo had tried
to hide his charms from every one when he
took them to Tamate, the natives had found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>out that they were on board. Though many
of these men loved Jesus Christ, they could
scarcely believe that the charms had no
power at all. When the ship struck the
reef they said, “Tamate has Aveo’s things,
and the ship is wrecked and Tamate
drowned.”</p>

<p>But in spite of the stormy seas every one
reached land safely. The ship was floated
off the reef and mended, and in a day or
two Tamate and the charms sailed away
out of the bay.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE BARRIER REEF</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE Tamate left Motu-motu for the
Fly River he went to Australia. The
<i>Harrier</i>&mdash;a little ship that took them from
village to village in New Guinea&mdash;was
broken and battered by the wild waves that
surged on the shores of the island. But
she had become so useful that the workers
in New Guinea could not do without something
in her stead while she was in dock
under repair. Mr. Chalmers went to get
another boat to do her work.</p>

<p>The <i>Harrier</i> crossed safely from New
Guinea to the coast of Australia through
stormy seas. She came to the great
Barrier Reef that lies along the shore of
that part of Australia. At some parts the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>reef is more than fifty miles out to sea, at
others it runs almost close to the rocks of
the shore. It has openings through which
ships may enter the deep water within it.
The <i>Harrier</i> made for one of these some
distance north of Cooktown and entered it
safely.</p>

<p>Although the night was stormy, and the
wind against them, the crew were in great
spirits, and sang “Homeward Bound” as
they worked. They thought of their wives
and the other friends who would welcome
them in port. It was Thursday evening,
and now that they were safe within the
Barrier Reef they hoped to enter the
harbour next morning.</p>

<p>But the weather was against them.
Though they carried sail all night, they
found when morning came that they were
very little farther south than they had been
the night before. They could not sail
straight into Cooktown. They had to tack
backwards and forwards between the shore
and the reef. The wind was so strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>that it carried away some of the <i>Harrier’s</i>
sails. The anchor was let go beside Three
Islands, and the ship lay there till repairs
were finished.</p>

<p>At four o’clock on Friday afternoon she
set sail again. In the evening the captain
began to hope that if he tacked once more
out towards the reef he might bring her
into Cooktown harbour with the return
tack.</p>

<p>Tamate was in bed and half asleep. He
heard the captain come down and go to the
chart-room. Could there be any danger?
He was too sleepy to trouble about that.
A few minutes afterwards he was dreaming
of striking a rock&mdash;bump, thump, scrape!</p>

<p>But was he dreaming? He started up
wide-awake. In a minute he was dressed
and on deck.</p>

<p>All hands were at work. The sails were
hauled down. Then the ship’s boat was
launched. She carried an anchor out to
deep water. As soon as it held, the sailors
turned the windlass with all their strength.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>They hoped to heave the <i>Harrier</i> off the
rocks; but no, she was firm. All night
long each wave drove her against the reef.
As the tide fell she leaned over to one side
more and more till her crew could scarcely
move from place to place on her deck.
There was much work to do. They had
to drag on deck all the heavy things that
were on board, so that if she righted again
with the evening tide they might throw
them into the sea. They hoped that if she
was as light as possible they might heave
her off into deep water again.</p>

<p>All day long on Saturday they made
signals of distress. But the hours wore
on and there was no sign of help. They
were out of the channel in which ships
sailed for Cooktown.</p>

<p>The ship righted with the evening tide.
Over went everything of iron and all heavy
cargo into the sea. The men at the windlass
worked till it seemed that the anchor-hawser
would break. But the <i>Harrier</i> was
too firmly fixed; she would not move.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>The sea was still wild on Sunday morning.
No one knew if the ship’s boat could
live in it. Yet if the boat did not go to
seek for help, no one might see them and
then they would all be drowned. They
could not tell whether it was more dangerous
to go in the boat or to stay on the
ship. The <i>Harrier</i> was over on her side
again. Before the boat was sent off the
sailors slid and scrambled along the sloping
deck and cut the stays. Then the masts
were sawn partly through on the side of
the ship that was uppermost. Every one
climbed to the high edge of the deck, away
from all the ropes and rigging, and waited.
A great wave came. Crack, crack, went
the masts, and away into the sea went
masts and rigging that the ship might
have a better chance of holding together
till help could come.</p>

<p>Then the boat was manned. It was not
easy to get into her down the side of the
<i>Harrier</i>, whilst the waves dashed her wildly
hither and thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“What are you doing?” shouted Tamate,
still on the deck of the <i>Harrier</i>, to a sailor
who was diving down to the hold searching
for something.</p>

<p>“Looking for the poor old cat, sir.”</p>

<p>He found him, too, and puss was dropped
through the spray into the boat.</p>

<p>Then Tamate found another pet, a young
cockatoo, half dead with fear, and screeching
at the pitch of his voice.</p>

<p>“What about ‘cockie’?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, we save him. He go in boat!”</p>

<p>So the boat with her strange crew rowed
away. After fighting with the waves for
two hours she reached the Three Islands.
On one of the islands they found some
empty huts that had been used by divers.
There they lit a fire. Then they set fire
to a patch of long grass on the island, in
the hope that some passing ship might
see the blaze.</p>

<p>The cat and the cockatoo were very
funny. Puss had been so long at sea that
he hated the dry land as much as most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>cats hate water. He was brought to land,
but at each step on the sand he lifted his
paw and shook it, and then suddenly he
darted back through the shallow water and
scrambled into the boat!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo6"><img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="400" alt="Puss was dropped into the boat"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Puss was dropped into the boat</p>

<p class="gap">“Cockie” was miserable. He stood helplessly
where he was set, and called for one
of the sailors, his special friend. When he
was taken to the fire he soon cheered
up, but he would not stay alone even
beside the fire. He looked very comical, with
his draggled feathers, as he followed the
sailors and scolded them if they left him.</p>

<p>On Monday morning a ship came near.
She picked up those on the island and
then steamed for the wreck. Even after
she got close to it, it took hours to fetch
all those still on board the <i>Harrier</i> from
her to the steamer.</p>

<p>When at last they steamed away towards
Cooktown, even the sadness they felt for
the loss of their ship was forgotten for a
little as they saw the harbour ahead of
them and knew that they were safe.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE FLY RIVER</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER Mr. Chalmers returned from this
voyage, he and his wife went away
to the mouth of the Fly River. The men
of the wild tribes who lived there were
not nearly so lovable as the savages of
Motu-motu, and Mrs. Chalmers found it
difficult to care as much for the ugly
cruel children of the island of Saguane,
where their home now was, as she had
done for the children at Motu-motu.</p>

<p>Many new plans were in Tamate’s mind.
It was not enough for him that schools
and churches were rising throughout New
Guinea; that war was ceasing; that, when
he landed at scattered villages, men and
women were waiting his coming, to say
openly to all, that they meant to follow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>Jesus Christ. He always wanted more.
As long as those wild tribes of the Fly
River fought and hated each other he
could not rest. He wished to do more
for them than to bring peace amongst
them. He hoped that some of the men
of those tribes at the mouth of the river,
who had learned to love his Master, would
go to live inland amongst the swamps
and marshes, where even his Rarotongan
teachers could not live. So he began to
train a band of these natives, as he had
trained the men of Rarotonga and Port
Moresby before.</p>

<p>In the midst of all his plans his wife
grew very ill. He nursed her for three
months, but her strength sank. The sea
was washing away the shore of the island
of Saguane where they lived, and they
found they must leave it. They went to
Daru, a village on the mainland, but Mrs.
Chalmers only lived one day there. She had
been very eager to reach this new home,
which was to be her last on earth. Her
wish came true. She was buried in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>native graveyard, and her husband was
left once more to work in loneliness.</p>

<p>He did not lose courage. He threw himself
more keenly than ever into his work.
But his own strength was failing, and he
found it harder to go long journeys without
rest. Sometimes he thought he was
growing lazy when he felt that he was not
able to do as much as he had once done.</p>

<p>One morning he set sail on the <i>Nieu</i>,
which had taken the place of the <i>Harrier</i>,
for Cape Blackwood. The natives there,
and on the large island near, were very
strong and fierce. Tamate knew that he
might be killed, but then he knew, too,
that if he could win those wild men, he
would take away the great barrier between
Christ and the tribes who lived round the
gulf of water into which the Fly River
flowed. If these men were to stop fighting
and to listen to the story of Christ,
other tribes would be glad to do so too.
They would be grateful to be free from
the fear of these cruel warriors.</p>

<p>It did not matter much to Tamate whether
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>it was by his life or by his death that he
won them. Either way he must break
down the wall that shut out the joy of
life from so many people.</p>

<p>There was a young friend who had come
to New Guinea with the same hopes that
Tamate himself had. This friend had been
with him for a year, and had been like a
son to him in his sorrow. He went with him
on this voyage. Besides these two, there
were on board Hiro a teacher, Naragi a
chief, ten boys who were in training, and
the captain.</p>

<p>When the <i>Nieu</i> came to the island, she
anchored near the village of Dopima.
When the villagers saw the ship, they
ran down to the shore and tumbled into
their canoes. In a very short time the
<i>Nieu</i> had canoes lying all round her, and
natives were climbing up her sides. No
one could say how many of them there
were. Savages had often come on board
when Tamate’s ship lay at anchor, but these
seemed to be more wilful and fierce than
most of the others had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>At last, as the sun went down behind the
island on which their village stood, Tamate
ordered them to go home, and said that if
they went at once he would land at Dopima
and see them next day.</p>

<p>They went away, but when the morning
came they would not wait till he could keep
his promise. At five o’clock their canoes
crossed the water to the <i>Nieu</i>. There were
many more of the villagers than there had
been on the evening of the day before. The
deck was so crowded that the men on board
could scarcely move about. All around
them on their own ship there were dark
and angry faces, and in their ears was the
clamour of excited voices.</p>

<p>It was not a peaceful welcome that the
canoes had brought. They were full of
bows and arrows, clubs and spears. Tamate
bade the natives begone, but they would
not. Then he thought that if he went
himself, although it was so early, they
would follow him.</p>

<p>He left the Rarotongan teacher with the
captain in the <i>Nieu</i>. He wished his young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>friend to stay too. He did not wish him
to risk his life, because he hoped that he
would live a long time, and carry on the
work that he himself had begun. The two
men looked at each other. They knew
there was great danger. They had seen
the hatred and bitterness in the faces of
the wild men around them. But Tamate
had said he would go. He had never
failed to keep his promise to the men and
women he sought to help. He would not
do it now. And his friend would never let
him go alone with that wild mob. The two
men stepped into the boat together. The
chief and the ten boys joined them, and
they rowed for the shore.</p>

<p>The splash of the oars sounded faintly
through the shrill shouts of the natives.
But Tamate’s clear voice rang over all the
noise. “Back in half-an-hour to breakfast.”</p>

<p>A rush of canoes followed the boat. But
those in her looked anxious when they
saw how many canoes stayed by the <i>Nieu</i>.
What could two men do if the natives
tried to take the ship?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>When the boat reached Dopima the two
white men and some of the boys landed
and went to the great clubhouse. It was
the place where all the fighting men met.
The other boys stayed to take care of the
boat, but soon villagers came to tell them
that they too must come to the clubhouse
to eat. To feast together is a sign of
peace. Tamate was never willing to refuse
to eat with the natives. His boys
knew this, and left the boat by the shore.</p>

<p>As they feasted in the clubhouse a crash
was heard. Naragi and the boys who had
come from Daru sprang up. Before them
Tamate and his young friend lay dead.</p>

<p>None of them had noticed two armed
men who crept along the floor behind the
white men till with two blows from their
great stone clubs they killed them both.</p>

<p>No one had ever been able to look in
Tamate’s face and still be angry with him.
But from behind a native had had courage
to strike him. His eyes could not awe the
savage then.</p>

<p>He lay dead. His boys had no hope of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>escape. One by one they fell beside their
master. Naragi fought for his life. He
had no weapons, but when he saw the
white men fall, he leapt forward and
seized another man’s club. But one man
could not stand long against all those
howling warriors, and soon he too lay
quiet and still.</p>

<p>The men from the clubhouse went down
in triumph to the shore to welcome the
others who had stayed by the ship. Their
canoes, which had shown only weapons,
were now piled high with everything that
could be lifted from the <i>Nieu</i>. The savages
danced and shouted on the beach as they
saw the things that had come from the
white man’s ship. The men were smeared
with war paint, and the clothes and books
that had been on the <i>Nieu</i> were soon
stained all over as one wild man after
another pounced on what he liked best.</p>

<p>After a time they began to tire of turning
over the treasures. A shout rose: “Let us
break the boat!”</p>

<p>They scampered off to the creek where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>the boys had left her. Smash! bang!
crash! the stone clubs fell on the beautiful
boat. She was the last gift that
Mrs. Chalmers had given to the work her
husband loved. Crack! crick! went the
wood. In a few minutes there was only
a pile of splinters. Each warrior took one.
Afterwards he stuck it up in his clubhouse
to show that he too had had a share
in the death of the great white chief.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Nieu</i> the captain and Hiro
had sent hurried glances after the boat as
she went towards the shore. They could
not look for long at a time, for they had to
try to keep the natives from breaking and
wrecking the ship. They saw the boat
grow smaller and smaller. They saw the
canoes close in upon it. Still they could
trace its course. They saw it reach the
village and go close to the shore. Then it
came out into deep water again. Again it
entered the village, and after that they
could not see it any more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo7"><img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="400" alt="No boat came"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">No boat came</p>

<p class="gap">No clear sounds came to them from
Dopima, but around them were many sounds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>Everything that could be taken was seized
and thrown into the canoes. It was hard
to see good things broken and soiled. But
the pain of that was nothing to the pain
that Hiro and the captain felt as the hours
went on and no signal reached them from
the shore.</p>

<p>At last the savages left them and quiet
settled down on the ship. The quiet was
more dreadful than the noise of the morning
had been. It left time to look and look
towards the shore for the boat that would
never come again.</p>

<p>The <i>Nieu</i> lifted her anchor and steamed
up and down. All day long she waited near
Dopima. After sunset she sailed out to
sea beyond the island and anchored there.
Next day she sailed along the shore again.
The two sad men on board gazed towards
the village but no boat came.</p>

<p>At last they sailed to Daru to tell that
the great white chief had died for his people.</p>

<p>Yet Tamate did not wish his friends to
think of him as dead, when they could not
see him any more. He wished them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>know that he lives and works gladly in the
great life beyond the grave, and that he
knows and loves his Master Jesus Christ
far better than he could on earth. Not very
long before he died, he had written of the
life after death, “I shall have good work to
do, great brave work for Christ.”</p>

<p>As the news of Tamate’s death came to
Daru, and Motu-motu, Port Moresby and
Suau, and to all the villages between them,
New Guinea was stricken with sorrow.
Men and women and children were sick
with grief.</p>

<p>Then the love they had for Tamate brought
a new strength. They wished to do more
for the work for which he died than they
had ever done before.</p>

<p>There was one old man called Rua. His
hands were weak but his heart was strong.
It was so good and strong that though it
had loved Tamate with passion, it did not
hate the men who had killed him.</p>

<p>Rua sat and mourned. His heart knew
the thoughts of the white chief’s heart.
Tamate had longed to win the love of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>wild men of Dopima for Jesus Christ. He
had died for this. Would his death be in
vain? No, it must not be! It might be
that Rua could help. He might live for
the people for whom his friend had died.
The thought fired him. He wrote:</p>

<p>“May you have life and happiness. At
this time our hearts are very sad. Tamate
and the boys are not here. We shall not
see them again. I have wept much. My
father Tamate’s body I shall not see again,
but his spirit we shall certainly see in
heaven, if we are strong to do the work of
God, thoroughly and all the time. Hear my
wish. It is a great wish. My strength I
would spend in the place where he was
killed. In that village I would live. In
that place where they killed men, Jesus
Christ’s name and His word I would teach
to the people, that they may become Jesus’
children. My wish is just this. You know
it. I have spoken.”</p>

<p>Rua could not go to Dopima. A greater
joy came to him. Instead of going there
to live for Christ and for his friend, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>went on a longer journey, to be with Christ
and with his friend.</p>

<p>In the clubhouses round Dopima the
warriors had stuck up pieces of the broken
boat. They pointed to them at their feasts
as the signs of their great victory over
the white chief and his power.</p>

<p>But in Dopima and all over New Guinea,
the death that had seemed to give them
the victory was in truth a triumph for the
army of Christ. Weak hearts grew brave
at the thought of it. Men and women
came forward to fight for the Hero whom
Tamate had followed even unto death, Jesus
Christ, who died for those who hated Him,
because He loved them.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
